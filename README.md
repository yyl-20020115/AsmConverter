# AsmConverter
Converter for AT&amp;T and Intel format

This project is started because I need to translate the assembly files with AT&T syntax
inside the gmp project into Intel syntax which nasm supports.

This purpose is fullfilled. However the project is not ready for "everything".

Your help is well-welcomed to improve this project.
And the Intel to AT&T conversion needs to be done as well.

Best Regards,
Yilin
